'''
A left rotation operation on an array of size shifts each of the array's elements unit to the left. 
For example, if left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become .

Given an array of integers and a number , perform left rotations on the array. 
Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of (the number of integers) and (the number of left rotations you must perform).
The second line contains space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state

    remains = a[k:len(a)]
    
    return remains + rotators
